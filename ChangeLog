2015-08-26: Version 0.17.0

        (All Contributions below here are from @mikeatlas)
        Add GeometryCollection `contains` method
        Add GeoJSONReader `readAsGeometryCollection` to handle GeoJSON FeatureCollections correctly.
        Add jsbuild to prepublish npm package.json; requires sudo priviliges to install, otherwise there is a conflicting npm package with the same name and different options and could be confusing if you don't read the build/readme.txt
        Added ability to run raw jasmine (~>2.0) tests with `jasmine JASMINE_CONFIG_PATH=test/spec/support/jasmine.json`
        A few other minor cleanups here and there to make command line build/testing easier (no IDE needed)
