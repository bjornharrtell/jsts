This API documentation is for the ES5 builds for browser or Node Js use and describe the manually ported IO-classes. Note that the `jsts` module, via translated source, also exposes the same public API as `org.locationtech.jts` in the [JTS API](http://bjornharrtell.github.io/jsts/1.2.1/apidocs/) that is not shown here.
