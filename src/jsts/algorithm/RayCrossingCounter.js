/**
 * Counts the number of segments crossed by a horizontal ray extending to the
 * right from a given point, in an incremental fashion. This can be used to
 * determine whether a point lies in a {@link Polygonal} geometry. The class
 * determines the situation where the point lies exactly on a segment. When
 * being used for Point-In-Polygon determination, this case allows
 * short-circuiting the evaluation.
 * <p>
 * This class handles polygonal geometries with any number of shells and holes.
 * The orientation of the shell and hole rings is unimportant. In order to
 * compute a correct location for a given polygonal geometry, it is essential
 * that <b>all</b> segments are counted which
 * <ul>
 * <li>touch the ray
 * <li>lie in in any ring which may contain the point
 * </ul>
 * The only exception is when the point-on-segment situation is detected, in
 * which case no further processing is required. The implication of the above
 * rule is that segments which can be a priori determined to <i>not</i> touch
 * the ray (i.e. by a test of their bounding box or Y-extent) do not need to be
 * counted. This allows for optimization by indexing.
