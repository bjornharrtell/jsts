 *  <H3>Binary Predicates</H3>
 * Because it is not clear at this time
 * what semantics for spatial
 *  analysis methods involving <code>GeometryCollection</code>s would be useful,
 *  <code>GeometryCollection</code>s are not supported as arguments to binary
 *  predicates (other than <code>convexHull</code>) or the <code>relate</code>
 *  method.
 *
 *  <H3>Set-Theoretic Methods</H3>
 *
 *  The spatial analysis methods will
 *  return the most specific class possible to represent the result. If the
 *  result is homogeneous, a <code>Point</code>, <code>LineString</code>, or
 *  <code>Polygon</code> will be returned if the result contains a single
 *  element; otherwise, a <code>MultiPoint</code>, <code>MultiLineString</code>,
 *  or <code>MultiPolygon</code> will be returned. If the result is
 *  heterogeneous a <code>GeometryCollection</code> will be returned. <P>
 *
 *  Because it is not clear at this time what semantics for set-theoretic
 *  methods involving <code>GeometryCollection</code>s would be useful,
 * <code>GeometryCollections</code>
 *  are not supported as arguments to the set-theoretic methods.
 *
 *  <H4>Representation of Computed Geometries </H4>
 *
 *  The SFS states that the result
 *  of a set-theoretic method is the "point-set" result of the usual
 *  set-theoretic definition of the operation (SFS 3.2.21.1). However, there are
 *  sometimes many ways of representing a point set as a <code>Geometry</code>.
 *  <P>
 *
 *  The SFS does not specify an unambiguous representation of a given point set
 *  returned from a spatial analysis method. One goal of JTS is to make this
 *  specification precise and unambiguous. JTS will use a canonical form for
 *  <code>Geometry</code>s returned from spatial analysis methods. The canonical
 *  form is a <code>Geometry</code> which is simple and noded:
 *  <UL>
 *    <LI> Simple means that the Geometry returned will be simple according to
 *    the JTS definition of <code>isSimple</code>.
 *    <LI> Noded applies only to overlays involving <code>LineString</code>s. It
 *    means that all intersection points on <code>LineString</code>s will be
 *    present as endpoints of <code>LineString</code>s in the result.
 *  </UL>
 *  This definition implies that non-simple geometries which are arguments to
 *  spatial analysis methods must be subjected to a line-dissolve process to
 *  ensure that the results are simple.
 *
 *  <H4> Constructed Points And The Precision Model </H4>
 *
 *  The results computed by the set-theoretic methods may contain constructed
 *  points which are not present in the input <code>Geometry</code>.
 *  These new points arise from intersections between line segments in the
 *  edges of the input <code>Geometry</code>s. In the general case it is not
 *  possible to represent constructed points exactly. This is due to the fact
 *  that the coordinates of an intersection point may contain twice as many bits
 *  of precision as the coordinates of the input line segments. In order to
 *  represent these constructed points explicitly, JTS must truncate them to fit
 *  the <code>PrecisionModel</code>.
 *
 *  Unfortunately, truncating coordinates moves them slightly. Line segments
 *  which would not be coincident in the exact result may become coincident in
 *  the truncated representation. This in turn leads to "topology collapses" --
 *  situations where a computed element has a lower dimension than it would in
 *  the exact result.
 *
 *  When JTS detects topology collapses during the computation of spatial
 *  analysis methods, it will throw an exception. If possible the exception will
 *  report the location of the collapse.
 *
 *  #equals(Object) and #hashCode are not overridden, so that when two
 *  topologically equal Geometries are added to HashMaps and HashSets, they
 *  remain distinct. This behaviour is desired in many cases.
